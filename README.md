MERN Stack Deployment with Kubernetes and Terraform

This project demonstrates the deployment of a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack application using Kubernetes for orchestration and Terraform for infrastructure provisioning. The application is containerized using Docker and deployed on AWS EKS.
Project Overview

The MERN application consists of:
	•	MongoDB: NoSQL database for managing user data.
	•	Express.js: Backend framework for API and server logic.
	•	React: Frontend framework for building the user interface.
	•	Node.js: Runtime environment for the backend application.

The goal is to containerize these components, orchestrate them using Kubernetes, and deploy them in a scalable and secure manner on AWS EKS.
Requirements

	•	Docker: 20.x or later
	•	Terraform: 1.5.x
	•	Kubernetes: 1.27.x
	•	kubectl: 1.27.x
	•	AWS CLI: 2.x
	•	Minikube: For local testing
	•	GitHub Actions: For CI/CD pipeline
